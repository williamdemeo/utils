## Some quick-and-dirty utilities...

*...they're not pretty, but they (sometimes) get the job done.*

-----------------------

This is a collection of some very ugly scripts that I use(d) to configure things.
They are not meant for public use and I'm only collecting them here so that
I can remember how I carried (or will carry) out these tasks in the past (future).

+ **git-purge** an ugly script to help remove all traces of a file from a git repository.

+ **dotfiles-setup** for configuring a Ubuntu box.

+ **progfun-setup** for setting up a Ubuntu box for the progfun Coursera course.
